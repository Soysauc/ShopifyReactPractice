# Shopify React Practice

Welcome to my attempt to practice working with the Shopify API to connect a React Application to the Shopify platform. I wanted to take this course form Udemy to continue my education in Shopify to further provide any clients with quality websites. Design and course inspired by Â© Copyright www.workingwithshopify.com

## Where next

I am also currently working on my certifications for the Shopify Partners Program and also the Shopify Foundations courses. I already had taken other courses on Udemy but would rather have the accredation through Shopify itself

### Liquid dev

I am also currently learning the Liquid templating language for another skill for the arsenal I am developing to further benefit my clientele and to expand my programming prowess.
